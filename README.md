Rust implementation of the classic python object oriented filesystem library.

<hr/>

Edit : Seems like rust has an [std::path](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/path/struct.Path.html) which implements the same functionality.

Nonetheless, this project still seems like fun to learn how to write idiomatic rust, so I'll try and derive my own implementation of python's pathlib and see how closely it resembles std::path's implementation/API.
